Put trajectories into this folder. Must be in JSON format and must be exported from the Simulation.

In the code, you can find the resource number of the trajectory with
```java
int trajectoryResourceNumber = R.raw.trajectory_name;
```
where trajectory_name is the name of the trajectory file without the .json extension.

Note: Cannot use folders. Must be in the root of the raw folder.
